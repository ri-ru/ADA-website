This rapid rise changed which categories became more or less common, and how creators approached their content.",N="From Indie to Industry: How YouTube Grew from 2008 to 2018",$="In 2008, uploads were limited, categories were modest in size, and creators were mostly experimenting. As the years pass in the visualization, you can see the platform steadily filling with more activity. By 2018 the number of uploads reaches more than fifteen million. Some categories grow slowly, others take off, and together they trace YouTube's shift from a small creator space into a much larger and more organised environment.",M="The chart follows the same story but from a different angle: what creators chose to include inside their videos. Links are grouped into three types: Monetization links such as amzn.to, amazon.com, patreon.com; Social links that lead to Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook; Content links to promote their own channels, previous videos on YouTube etc. From 2008 to 2018 all three lines rise. Year after year, more videos include at least one link. This simple pattern shows how creators changed their habits as the platform grew. In the early years many videos stood alone. Later, creators began pointing viewers to where they could support them, follow them, or find more of their work. It became common to add a link for income (monetization), a link for social presence (Social Links), or a link for more content. The two charts together tell a straightforward story: YouTube grew, and creators adapted. They posted more, reached wider audiences, and connected their videos to the rest of their online world.",O="Compare Categories",R="In this section you can compare categories side by side and see how their use of links changed over time. Once you select two categories, each chart shows four series: the share of uploads that include any link, and the shares that specifically include monetization, content, or social links. By placing two or more categories next to each other, you can see how differently creators in each space behaved. Some categories adopted social links earlier, some added monetization links later, and some steadily increased all types year after year.

Tell me which sponsors pay the most?",fe="[kaleb] Oof, that's a tough one... We don't really have the data on that. Although, we could look at which sponsors interact with which channels! Let's take channels <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, and <i>C</i>. Let's say that <i>A</i> is sponsored by sponsors $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, <i>B</i> by $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$, and <i>C</i> by $\\gamma$. Then <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> would have a connection of weight 2 between them and <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> a connection of weight 1. <i>A</i> and <i>C</i> would have no connection. Using this, we can build a graph.",ve="[jimmy] How do you know who sponsored a channel though?",ke='[kaleb] Good question! The short answer is <i>painfully</i>. You know how we mentioned earlier that video descriptions can contain URLs? Well we can look at those. However, a huge proportion of those URLs are <i>shortened</i>. URL shortening is when you use a service like <a href="https://bit.ly" target="_blank">bit.ly</a> to make a URL shorter. Here comes the hard part: there is absolutely no way to figure out the link a shortened URL points to without pinging the shortener service.',Te="[jimmy] Wow that sounds evil... How did you do it then?",Ie=`[kaleb] Since we weren't going to hack the shortening services to steal their hashing algorithms, we had to use clever brute force. To minimise the amount of data we were requesting, we used <code>HEAD</code> requests with a "no redirect" policy. This meant that in the <code>HEAD</code> response header, we could extract the address the shortened link immediately redirected to. Since making thousands of requests a second looked suspicious to certain shortening services, we used an exponential backoff strategy. This worked by waiting a random, exponentially increasing amount of time between failed requests. That way, it would eventually wait long enough to reset any rate limits. We also ran multiple HTTP clients in parallel and tried proxy...`,xe="[jimmy] Okay I get it &mdash; it was a bad time. That was the last hurdle right?",je="[vivian] We wish! Having the full URLs is great, but we don't know which ones are linked to monetisation yet. Think about it, people put all sorts of links in their descriptions: WikiPedia articles, social media profiles, personal websites... The list goes on!",Ye="[jimmy] But then how did you figure it out? There must be millions of links!",Ae="[vivian] We tried a bunch of different strategies. The one we ended up going for was to use the TODO:insert_llm_name model with a handful of manual examples to classify the URLs as monetised or not.",He="[jimmy] Then were you fine?!",Se=`[kaleb] Yes! Checkout the graph below. It's on a separate page because it runs preformance intense <a href="https://webassembly.org/" target="_blank">WebAssembly</a>.`,We='[kaleb] Notice you can toggle different colourmaps. <i>Connectivity</i> shows how many neighbours each node has (logarithmic scale), <i>Category</i> shows the channel category, <i>Subscriber</i> and <i>Videos</i> show the number of subscribers and videos (logarithmic scale), and <i>Activity</i> shows channels active in 2025 in blue, others in red. The most interesting colourmap is <i>Leiden</i>, which shows different community assignments by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiden_algorithm" target="_blank">Leiden algorithm</a>. In short, it is a community detection algorithm that optimises the modularity of the graph.',qe="How does a focus on professionalism affect engagement?",Be="In the sections above, the focus was mainly on patterns observed before indie channels become professional, as well as on the types of sponsors they attract. In this part, the focus turns to the relationship between sponsorship and engagement. This is an important aspect, as it would be useful for YouTube creators to know what to expect when they enter the world of sponsorship. This shift in mindset brings clear advantages for the creator, most notably the possibility of earning more money. However, the other side of the coin may be less positive, and although causation cannot be established, the goal here is to analyze the observed patterns and propose plausible interpretations.",Ce='First, some characteristics of sponsored vs. non-sponsored videos are compared within channels that have sponsors (restricting to channels with at least 5 sponsored videos in SponsorBlock, so it is representative). In the plot, for each category, video status (sponsored or not), and metric of interest (for example, video duration), the median per channel is first computed. Then, the median of these channel-wise medians is taken to obtain the values displayed. This procedure ensures that each channel has the same weight (even if some channels have many more videos than others) and that the final values can be interpreted as "typical" at the channel level.',Le="First of all, the like/dislike ratio is defined as like_count / (like_count + dislike_count), multiplied by 100, to get a comprehensive measure of viewer satisfaction (percentage of likes among all feedback). Notice the values for News & Politics compared to the other categories. No surprise: this is a more delicate, polarizing topic 😅. Apart from that, sponsored videos tend to reach a higher percentage of likes in most categories. This is quite interesting: even though the viewer is interrupted in the video (usually considered annoying), the higher budgets of sponsored videos may translate into better production quality, which viewers appreciate. All values in the plot are above 95.5%, meaning that the median viewer satisfaction is very high overall.",ze="Next, the focus moves to video duration and view counts. Without exception, sponsored videos are, on average, longer and more viewed than non-sponsored ones. Again, a plausible explanation is that sponsored videos have higher production means, leading to more polished content that attracts more viewers. Taken together, these results suggest a higher audience engagement for sponsored videos.",Ne="However, at this stage, jumping to conclusions would be premature, as it is also informative to examine how some metrics evolve around the first-ever sponsor appearance on a channel (turning point where a channel actually becomes labelled as sponsored). For this, the number of weeks relative to the first sponsor appearance is used (26 weeks before and after, to cover a full year). Two metrics are compared: delta_views and delta_subs, defined as the week-to-week differences in views and subscribers for each channel. Because channels display vastly different sizes, the logarithm of these differences is taken, then averaged for each relative week.",$e="On these plots, a steady increase in delta_views and delta_subs is visible before the first sponsor, indicating that channels are already in a growth phase before they attract sponsorship. Moreover, the confidence intervals are quite narrow, suggesting stable and reliable mean estimates.",Me="In the views plot, the week-to-week change in views increases as the first sponsor approaches (we can even see a jump at this first appearance), but a week after that point, the rate of change becomes slower than before (the slope is smaller).",Oe="For subscribers (note the change in the y-axis scale!), this pattern is even clearer. Here, the week-to-week gain in subscribers also increases as the first sponsor approaches (same with the observed jump), but then stabilizes to an approximately constant value. This indicates that channels continue to gain subscribers over time, but the rate of increase no longer rises as it did in the weeks leading up to the first sponsor.",Re="Ultimately, causal conclusions cannot be drawn, but the observed relationship between sponsorship and audience engagement can be summarized as follows: Your channel will probably need to already be in a steady growth phase before introducing its first sponsor. Even though sponsored videos are likely to be longer in duration, attract more views, and receive positive audience feedback overall, there will probably be a short period of strong growth in the channel around the time of your first sponsor, but followed by a slowdown in the growth rate (for both views and subscribers).
