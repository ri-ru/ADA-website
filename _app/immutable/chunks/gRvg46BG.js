It incorporates metadata for more than 72.9 million videos published on the platform between May 2005 and October 2019. In addition, it includes weekly channel-level time series spanning January 2015 to September 2019 for 153,550 channels, totaling 18,872,499 observations. While YouNiverse also includes other aspects (such as comment-related data), the analysis relies exclusively on the metadata and channel time-series elements described above. <br> Given the focus of the analysis on professionalism and sponsorship practices on YouTube, SponsorBlock data is paired with YouNiverse. SponsorBlock is an open-source browser extension enabling users to automatically skip chosen types of segments on YouTube videos (preview, credits, ...) and it is crowdsourced: users submit the start and end times of these segments. For the analysis, only the sponsor segment category is selected, thus including only videos with paid promotional content for a brand or product. <br> Together, these two datasets complement each other well. YouNiverse gives a broad view of YouTube (video- and channel-wise, evolution over time), while SponsorBlock adds sponsorship insights at the video scale.

Although, we could look at <b>which sponsors interact with which channels!</b>",_e="[jimmy] How do you know who sponsored a channel though?",we='[kaleb] Good question! The short answer is <i>painfully</i>. You know how we mentioned earlier that video descriptions can contain URLs? Well we can look at those. However, a huge proportion of those URLs are <i>shortened</i>. URL shortening is when you use a service like <a href="https://bit.ly" target="_blank">bit.ly</a> to make a URL shorter. Here comes the hard part: there is absolutely no way to figure out the link a shortened URL points to without pinging the shortener service.',ge="[jimmy] Wow that sounds evil... How did you do it then?",ye=`[kaleb] Since we weren't going to hack the shortening services to steal their hashing algorithms, we had to use clever brute force. To minimise the amount of data we were requesting, we used <code>HEAD</code> requests with a "no redirect" policy. This meant that in the <code>HEAD</code> response header, we could extract the address the shortened link immediately redirected to. Since making thousands of requests a second looked suspicious, we used an exponential backoff strategy. This worked by waiting a random, exponentially increasing amount of time between failed requests. That way, it would eventually wait long enough to reset any rate limits. We also ran multiple HTTP clients in parallel and tried proxy rotation...`,fe="[jimmy] Okay I get it &mdash; it was a bad time. That was the last hurdle right?",ve="[vivian] We wish! Having the full URLs is great, but we don't know which ones are linked to monetisation yet. Think about it, people put all sorts of links in their descriptions: WikiPedia articles, social media profiles, personal websites... The list goes on!",ke="[jimmy] But then how did you figure it out? There must be millions of links!",Te="[vivian] We tried a bunch of different strategies. The one we ended up going for was to use the <b>TODO:insert_llm_name</b> model with a handful of manual examples to classify the URLs as monetised or not.",Ie="[jimmy] Then were you fine?!",xe=`[kaleb] Yes! Checkout the graph below. It's on a separate page because it runs preformance intense <a href="https://webassembly.org/" target="_blank">WebAssembly</a>.`,je=`Let's take channels <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, and <i>C</i>. Let's say that <i>A</i> is sponsored by sponsors $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, <i>B</i> by $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$, and <i>C</i> by $\\gamma$. Then <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> would have a connection of weight 2 between them and <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> a connection of weight 1. <i>A</i> and <i>C</i> would have no connection. Using this, we can build a graph. <br> Notice you can toggle different colourmaps. <i>Connectivity</i> shows how many neighbours each node has (logarithmic scale), <i>Category</i> shows the channel category, <i>Subscriber</i> and <i>Videos</i> show the number of subscribers and videos (logarithmic scale), and <i>Activity</i> shows channels active in 2025 in blue, others in red. The most interesting colourmap is <i>Leiden</i>, which shows different community assignments by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiden_algorithm" target="_blank">Leiden algorithm</a>. In short, it is a community detection algorithm that optimises the modularity of the graph.`,Ye="[kaleb] ...",Ae="How does a focus on professionalism affect engagement?",We="[jimmy] Thanks for all these explanations, but can I know what will happen once I get my first sponsor?",$e="[daniel] Ok, then let's study the relationship between sponsorship and engagement! I bet you would like to know what to expect after you enter the world of sponsorship 😁",He="[jimmy] Sure! Will my YouTube stats skyrocket?!",Ne="[daniel] Take a chill pill! Don't forget that establishing causation is very hard, thus my goal is to analyze and show you the observed patterns and propose plausible interpretations.",qe="[jimmy] Ok, I'm listening carefully then...",Se='First, some characteristics of sponsored vs. non-sponsored videos are compared within channels that have sponsors (restricting to channels with at least 5 sponsored videos in SponsorBlock, so it is representative). In the plot, for each category, video status (sponsored or not), and metric of interest (for example, video duration), the median per channel is first computed. Then, the median of these channel-wise medians is taken to obtain the values displayed. This procedure ensures that each channel has the same weight (even if some channels have many more videos than others) and that the final values can be interpreted as "typical" at the channel level.',Be="First of all, the like/dislike ratio is defined as $\\frac{\\text{like\\_count}}{\\text{like\\_count} + \\text{dislike\\_count}} \\cdot 100$, to get a comprehensive measure of viewer satisfaction (percentage of likes among all feedback). Notice the values for News & Politics compared to the other categories. No surprise: this is a more delicate, polarizing topic 😅. Apart from that, sponsored videos tend to reach a higher percentage of likes in most categories. This is quite interesting: even though the viewer is interrupted in the video (usually considered annoying), the higher budgets of sponsored videos may translate into better production quality, which viewers appreciate. All values in the plot are above 95.5%, meaning that the median viewer satisfaction is very high overall.",Le="Next, the focus moves to video duration and view counts. Without exception, sponsored videos are, on average, longer and more viewed than non-sponsored ones. Again, a plausible explanation is that sponsored videos have higher production means, leading to more polished content that attracts more viewers. Taken together, these results suggest a higher audience engagement for sponsored videos.",Ce="However, at this stage, jumping to conclusions would be premature, as it is also informative to examine how some metrics evolve around the first-ever sponsor appearance on a channel (turning point where a channel actually becomes labelled as sponsored). For this, the number of weeks relative to the first sponsor appearance is used (26 weeks before and after, to cover a full year). Two metrics are compared: delta_views and delta_subs, defined as the week-to-week differences in views and subscribers for each channel. Because channels display vastly different sizes, the logarithm of these differences is taken, then averaged for each relative week.",Oe="On these plots, a steady increase in delta_views and delta_subs is visible before the first sponsor, indicating that channels are already in a growth phase before they attract sponsorship. Moreover, the confidence intervals are quite narrow, suggesting stable and reliable mean estimates.",Re="In the views plot, the week-to-week change in views increases as the first sponsor approaches (we can even see a jump at this first appearance), but a week after that point, the rate of change becomes slower than before (the slope is smaller).",Me="For subscribers (note the change in the y-axis scale!), this pattern is even clearer. Here, the week-to-week gain in subscribers also increases as the first sponsor approaches (same with the observed jump), but then stabilizes to an approximately constant value. This indicates that channels continue to gain subscribers over time, but the rate of increase no longer rises as it did in the weeks leading up to the first sponsor.",De="[daniel] Let's summarize the results: Your channel will probably need to already be in a steady growth phase before introducing its first sponsor. Even though sponsored videos are likely to be longer in duration, attract more views, and receive positive audience feedback overall, there will probably be a short period of strong growth in the channel around the time of your first sponsor, but followed by a slowdown in the growth rate (for both views and subscribers).
