Yould would also need to have published <b><vids> videos</b> on median. In comparison, the medians of the global distributions over all categories are <b><gen_views> views</b>, <b><gen_subs> subscribers</b>, and <b><gen_vids> videos</b> </br> <span class="bubble-hint"> Note the logarithmic x axes, and the logarithmic y axis for activity.

Look at the proportions of channels still active in 2025.

We can test this using a paired t-test between categories. The results show a significant ($p < 0.01$) <b>16.12%</b> difference in activity! Whether this is caused by obtaining a sponsorship is a different question though...",me="[jimmy] So you <i>can</i> make YouTube your job!",ue="[kaleb] That's not what I...",_e="[jimmy] I need to start right away! Tell me which sponsors pay the most?",be="[kaleb] Oof, that's a tough one... We don't really have the data on that. Although, we could look at which sponsors interact with which channels! Let's take channels <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, and <i>C</i>. Let's say that <i>A</i> is sponsored by sponsors $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, <i>B</i> by $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$, and <i>C</i> by $\\gamma$. Then <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> would have a connection of weight 2 between them and <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> a connection of weight 1. <i>A</i> and <i>C</i> would have no connection. Using this, we can build a graph.",we="[jimmy] How do you know who sponsored a channel though?",pe='[kaleb] Good question! The short answer is <i>painfully</i>. You know how we mentioned earlier that video descriptions can contain URLs? Well we can look at those. However, a huge proportion of those URLs are <i>shortened</i>. URL shortening is when you use a service like <a href="https://bit.ly" target="_blank">bit.ly</a> to make a URL shorter. Here comes the hard part: there is absolutely no way to figure out the link a shortened URL points to without pinging the shortener service.',ge="[jimmy] Wow that sounds evil... How did you do it then?",ye=`[kaleb] Since we weren't going to hack the shortening services to steal their hashing algorithms, we had to use clever brute force. To minimise the amount of data we were requesting, we used <code>HEAD</code> requests with a "no redirect" policy. This meant that in the <code>HEAD</code> response header, we could extract the address the shortened link immediately redirected to. Since making thousands of requests a second looked suspicious to certain shortening services, we used an exponential backoff strategy. This worked by waiting a random, exponentially increasing amount of time between failed requests. That way, it would eventually wait long enough to reset any rate limits. We also ran multiple HTTP clients in parallel and tried proxy...`,fe="[jimmy] Okay I get it &mdash; it was a bad time. That was the last hurdle right?",ke="[vivian] We wish! Having the full URLs is great, but we don't know which ones are linked to monetisation yet. Think about it, people put all sorts of links in their descriptions: WikiPedia articles, social media profiles, personal websites... The list goes on!",ve="[jimmy] But then how did you figure it out? There must be millions of links!",Te="[vivian] We tried a bunch of different strategies. The one we ended up going for was to use the TODO:insert_llm_name model with a handful of manual examples to classify the URLs as monetised or not.",Ie="[jimmy] Then were you fine?!",je=`[kaleb] Yes! Checkout the graph below.
