  "section1_intro": "YouTube grew from 338k uploads in 2008 to over 15.2 million in 2018. This rapid rise changed which categories became more or less common, and how creators approached their content.",
  "viz_main_title": "From Indie to Industry: How YouTube Grew from 2008 to 2018",
  "viz_main_desc": "In 2008, uploads were limited, categories were modest in size, and creators were mostly experimenting. As the years pass in the visualization, you can see the platform steadily filling with more activity. By 2018 the number of uploads reaches more than fifteen million. Some categories grow slowly, others take off, and together they trace YouTube's shift from a small creator space into a much larger and more organised environment.",
  "viz_focus_desc": "The chart follows the same story but from a different angle: what creators chose to include inside their videos. Links are grouped into three types: Monetization links such as amzn.to, amazon.com, patreon.com; Social links that lead to Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook; Content links to promote their own channels, previous videos on YouTube etc. From 2008 to 2018 all three lines rise. Year after year, more videos include at least one link. This simple pattern shows how creators changed their habits as the platform grew. In the early years many videos stood alone. Later, creators began pointing viewers to where they could support them, follow them, or find more of their work. It became common to add a link for income (monetization), a link for social presence (Social Links), or a link for more content. The two charts together tell a straightforward story: YouTube grew, and creators adapted. They posted more, reached wider audiences, and connected their videos to the rest of their online world.",
  "viz_compare_title": "Compare Categories",
  "viz_compare_desc": "In this section you can compare categories side by side and see how their use of links changed over time. Once you select two categories, each chart shows four series: the share of uploads that include any link, and the shares that specifically include monetization, content, or social links. By placing two or more categories next to each other, you can see how differently creators in each space behaved. Some categories adopted social links earlier, some added monetization links later, and some steadily increased all types year after year. This view helps you explore these patterns in a clear, year-by-year way and understand how linking habits vary across the YouTube ecosystem.",

  "section2_chat_7": "[kaleb] Ever heard of the sunk cost fallacy? A story for another day. Metrics your channel will likely need to reach before your first sponsor depend on the category of videos you want to make. How about you pick one?",

  "section2_chat_9": "[kaleb] <joke> On median, you would need a total of around <b><views> views</b> and <b><subs> subscribers</b>. Yould would also need to have published <b><vids> videos</b> on median.

  "section2_chat_11": "[kaleb] Interesting strategy... It does happen but only quite rarely.

  "section2_chat_14": "[kaleb] More than you might think! Look at the proportions of channels still active in 2025. The YouNiverse dataset only goes until 2019, so these data had to be collected using the <a href=\\"https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3\\" target=\\"_blank\\">YouTube API</a>.",

  "section2_chat_17": "[kaleb] Notice how the sponsored channels seem to consistently be more active in 2025 than the non-sponsored ones? We can test this using a paired t-test between categories. The results show a significant ($p < 0.01$) <b>16.12%</b> difference in activity! Whether this is caused by obtaining a sponsorship is a different question though...",

  "section2_chat_20": "[jimmy] I need to start right away! Tell me which sponsors pay the most?",
  "section2_chat_21": "[kaleb] Oof, that's a tough one... We don't really have the data on that. Although, we could look at which sponsors interact with which channels! Let's take channels <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, and <i>C</i>. Let's say that <i>A</i> is sponsored by sponsors $\\\\alpha$ and $\\\\beta$, <i>B</i> by $\\\\alpha$, $\\\\beta$, and $\\\\gamma$, and <i>C</i> by $\\\\gamma$. Then <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> would have a connection of weight 2 between them and <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> a connection of weight 1. <i>A</i> and <i>C</i> would have no connection. Using this, we can build a graph.",
  "section2_chat_22": "[jimmy] How do you know who sponsored a channel though?",
  "section2_chat_23": "[kaleb] Good question! The short answer is <i>painfully</i>. You know how we mentioned earlier that video descriptions can contain URLs? Well we can look at those. However, a huge proportion of those URLs are <i>shortened</i>. URL shortening is when you use a service like <a href=\\"https://bit.ly\\" target=\\"_blank\\">bit.ly</a> to make a URL shorter. Here comes the hard part: there is absolutely no way to figure out the link a shortened URL points to without pinging the shortener service.",
  "section2_chat_24": "[jimmy] Wow that sounds evil... How did you do it then?",
  "section2_chat_25": "[kaleb] Since we weren't going to hack the shortening services to steal their hashing algorithms, we had to use clever brute force. To minimise the amount of data we were requesting, we used <code>HEAD</code> requests with a \\"no redirect\\" policy. This meant that in the <code>HEAD</code> response header, we could extract the address the shortened link immediately redirected to. Since making thousands of requests a second looked suspicious to certain shortening services, we used an exponential backoff strategy. This worked by waiting a random, exponentially increasing amount of time between failed requests. That way, it would eventually wait long enough to reset any rate limits. We also ran multiple HTTP clients in parallel and tried proxy...",
  "section2_chat_26": "[jimmy] Okay I get it &mdash; it was a bad time. That was the last hurdle right?",
  "section2_chat_27": "[vivian] We wish! Having the full URLs is great, but we don't know which ones are linked to monetisation yet. Think about it, people put all sorts of links in their descriptions: WikiPedia articles, social media profiles, personal websites... The list goes on!",
  "section2_chat_28": "[jimmy] But then how did you figure it out? There must be millions of links!",
  "section2_chat_29": "[vivian] We tried a bunch of different strategies. The one we ended up going for was to use the TODO:insert_llm_name model with a handful of manual examples to classify the URLs as monetised or not.",
  "section2_chat_30": "[jimmy] Then were you fine?!",
  "section2_chat_31": "[kaleb] Yes! Checkout the graph below. It's on a separate page because it runs preformance intense <a href=\\"https://webassembly.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">WebAssembly</a>.",
  "section2_chat_32": "[kaleb] Notice you can toggle different colourmaps. <i>Connectivity</i> shows how many neighbours each node has (logarithmic scale), <i>Category</i> shows the channel category, <i>Subscriber</i> and <i>Videos</i> show the number of subscribers and videos (logarithmic scale), and <i>Activity</i> shows channels active in 2025 in blue, others in red. The most interesting colourmap is <i>Leiden</i>, which shows different community assignments by the <a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiden_algorithm\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Leiden algorithm</a>.
