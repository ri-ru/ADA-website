  "section2_chat_5": "[kaleb] The median time between posting your first video and obtaining your first sponsor is <b>1108 days</b> or around <b>3 years</b>! It also takes a median of <b>148 videos</b>! </br> <span class=\\"bubble-hint\\">Note the logarithmic x axes. The right plot seems to follow a log-normal distribtion, whereas the left plot obtained $\\\\lambda = 0.429\\\\pm 0.017$ with a <a href=\\"https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.boxcox.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Box-Cox transformation</a>, suggesting it is gamma-like.</span>",\r
  "section2_chat_6": "[jimmy] Three years!!! I want to throw up. But what kind of stats do I need to get my first sponsor? Maybe if I buy enough bot accounts...",\r
  "section2_chat_7": "[kaleb] Every heard of the sunk cost fallacy? A story for another day. Metrics your channel will likely need to reach before your first sponsor depend on the category of videos you want to make. How about you pick one?",\r
  "section2_chat_8": "[jimmy] Maybe <b><cat></b>?",\r
  "section2_chat_9": "[kaleb] <joke> On median, you would need a total of around <b><views> views</b> and <b><subs> subscribers</b>. Yould would also need to have published <b><vids> videos</b> on median. In comparison, the medians of the global distributions over all categories are <b><gen_views> views</b>, <b><gen_subs> subscribers</b>, and <b><gen_vids> videos</b> </br> <span class=\\"bubble-hint\\"> Note the logarithmic x axes, and the logarithmic y axis for activity. All distributions seem to be log-normal, apart from activity, which seems to follow a power law. This might suggest that the activity has little-to-no effect on getting sponsored.</span>",\r
  "section2_chat_10": "[jimmy] There are definitely some differences between categories, but I still don't know what to pick... And the longer I take to decide, the closer I get to having to explain a 1k transfer to <i>\\"sheNaNigans incoporated\\"</i>. Aargh! Do I really have to choose or can I just pick whatever and switch once I get sponsored?",\r
  "section2_chat_11": "[kaleb] Interesting strategy... It does happen but only quite rarely. If we look at the <b>6 months before</b> the first sponsor and the <b>6 months after</b>, and we compare the most common video categories in both periods, we get a sense of what kind of transitions people make. </br> <span class=\\"bubble-hint\\">Note the connections shown below are logarithmic.<span>",\r

  "section2_chat_13": "[jimmy] I don't know... How sustainable could it really be?",\r
  "section2_chat_14": "[kaleb] More than you might think! Look at the proportions of channels still active in 2025. The YouNiverse dataset only goes until 2019, so these data had to be collected using the <a href=\\"https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3\\" target=\\"_blank\\">YouTube API</a>.",\r
  "section2_chat_15": "[eddie] Yeah it was a real pain to get. I have so many API keys now...",\r
  "section2_chat_16": "[kaleb] You can choose to look at all channels or compare sponsored and non-sponsored channels!",\r
  "section2_chat_17": "[kaleb] Notice how the sponsored channels seem to consistently be more active in 2025 than the non-sponsored ones? We can test this using a paired t-test between categories. The results show a significant ($p < 0.01$) <b>16.12%</b> difference in activity! Whether this is caused by obtaining a sponsorship is a different question though...",\r
  "section2_chat_18": "[jimmy] So you <i>can</i> make YouTube your job!",\r
  "section2_chat_19": "[kaleb] That's not what I...",\r
  "section2_chat_20": "[jimmy] I need to start right away! Tell me which sponsors pay the most?",\r
  "section2_chat_21": "[kaleb] Oof, that's a tough one... We don't really have the data on that. Although, we could look at which sponsors interact with which channels! Let's take channels <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, and <i>C</i>. Let's say that <i>A</i> is sponsored by sponsors $\\\\alpha$ and $\\\\beta$, <i>B</i> by $\\\\alpha$, $\\\\beta$, and $\\\\gamma$, and <i>C</i> by $\\\\gamma$. Then <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> would have a connection of weight 2 between them and <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> a connection of weight 1. <i>A</i> and <i>C</i> would have no connection. Using this, we can build a graph.",\r
  "section2_chat_22": "[jimmy] How do you know who sponsored a channel though?",\r
  "section2_chat_23": "[kaleb] Good question! The short answer is <i>painfully</i>. You know how we mentioned earlier that video descriptions can contain URLs? Well we can look at those. However, a huge proportion of those URLs are <i>shortened</i>. URL shortening is when you use a service like <a href=\\"https://bit.ly\\" target=\\"_blank\\">bit.ly</a> to make a URL shorter. Here comes the hard part: there is absolutely no way to figure out the link a shortened URL points to without pinging the shortener service.",\r
  "section2_chat_24": "[jimmy] Wow that sounds evil... How did you do it then?",\r
  "section2_chat_25": "[kaleb] Since we weren't going to hack the shortening services to steal their hashing algorithms, we had to use clever brute force. To minimise the amount of data we were requesting, we used <code>HEAD</code> requests with a \\"no redirect\\" policy. This meant that in the <code>HEAD</code> response header, we could extract the address the shortened link immediately redirected to. Since making thousands of requests a second looked suspicious to certain shortening services, we used an exponential backoff strategy. This worked by waiting a random, exponentially increasing amount of time between failed requests. That way, it would eventually wait long enough to reset any rate limits. We also ran multiple HTTP clients in parallel and tried proxy...",\r
  "section2_chat_26": "[jimmy] Okay I get it &mdash; it was a bad time. That was the last hurdle right?",\r
  "section2_chat_27": "[vivian] We wish! Having the full URLs is great, but we don't know which ones are linked to monetisation yet. Think about it, people put all sorts of links in their descriptions: WikiPedia articles, social media profiles, personal websites... The list goes on!",\r
  "section2_chat_28": "[jimmy] But then how did you figure it out? There must be millions of links!",\r
  "section2_chat_29": "[vivian] We tried a bunch of different strategies. The one we ended up going for was to use the TODO:insert_llm_name model with a handful of manual examples to classify the URLs as monetised or not.",\r
  "section2_chat_30": "[jimmy] Then were you fine?!",\r
  "section2_chat_31": "[kaleb] Yes! Checkout the graph below. It's on a separate page because it runs preformance intense <a href=\\"https://webassembly.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">WebAssembly</a>.",\r
  "section2_chat_32": "[kaleb] Notice you can toggle different colourmaps. <i>Connectivity</i> shows how many neighbours each node has (logarithmic scale), <i>Category</i> shows the channel category, <i>Subscriber</i> and <i>Videos</i> show the number of subscribers and videos (logarithmic scale), and <i>Activity</i> shows channels active in 2025 in blue, others in red. The most interesting colourmap is <i>Leiden</i>, which shows different community assignments by the <a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiden_algorithm\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Leiden algorithm</a>. In short, it is a community detection algorithm that optimises the modularity of the graph.",\r
